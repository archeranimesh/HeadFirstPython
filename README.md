# O'Reilly Media, Inc | Head First Python, 2nd Edition #
## By: Paul Barry ##

I am on my journey to enhance my knowledge of Python. In this quest I am using [Head First Python ](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-python/9781491919521/) book as one of the guiding lights. This repository will act as a place to store my notes and sample code from the book as it is said keeping notes while learning is a good practice.

My understanding of copyright laws is limited and hence if this process of making notes from books and publishing in Github in any way violates and such laws kindly contact me for removing the content. 

I am giving all necessary reference and credits for these notes.
