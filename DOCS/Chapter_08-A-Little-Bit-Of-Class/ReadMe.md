# Chapter 08 | A Little Bit of Class | Abstracting Behavior and State #

* Classes let us bundle code behavior and the state together.
* Python borrows its programming approaches from these
    * Object-Oriented
    * Functional
    * Procedural


## Object Oriented Primer ##

* Python with its Object-Oriented Paradigm supports
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation
* A class bundles **behavior** and **state**.
    - Behavior means function.
    - State means variables.
* A class in Python has **methods** and **attributes**.
    - Methods is the OOP name given to a function defined inside a Class.
    - Attributes is the name given to variables inside a Class.
