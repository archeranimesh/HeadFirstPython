## Data and Processing ##
Programming is the job of working with data. We are inclined to know these with data.
* acquiring data
* processing data
* understanding data.

The first challenge to work with data is to store it efficiently. Python provides us with these options.
* **Lists**
* **Dictionaries**
* **Tuples**
* **Sets**

## Basic Data Type ##
We can use the basic data type, to work with single data value. 
Basic data types are:-
* **Numbers**
    - A variables takes the type from the values what is assigned.
    - `wait_time = random.randint(1,60)`
* **Strings**
    - Python dynamically assigns type to a variable.
    - `word = "bottles"`
* **Objects**
    - Everything is an object in Python.
    - Since objects can be assigned to variables, an interesting combination occurs in Python.
    - Objects have **state** (attributes and values) and **behavior** (methods).
    - Python's objected oriented programming is optional. We can still write programs in python without using classes.
